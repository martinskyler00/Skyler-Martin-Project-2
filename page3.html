<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>Before I was an Applied Analytics major, I was an Architecture major. My interest in photography piqued through traveling to different sites around Chicago and taking pictures. Some neighborhoods I have travelled to include Pullman, South Shore, Gold Coast, Breidgeport, Wicker Park, Goose Island, and the Loop.</p>

    <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>When I was younger, I enjoyed watching any sport and playing soccer. The sports I keep up with the most today are football, basketball, baseball, college football, and soccer.</p>
      <p>My favorite teams are the Chicago Bears, the Chicago Bulls, the Chicago White Sox, Notre Dame, and Manchester United.</p>
    <h2>Video Editing</h2>
      <p>Before I made the decision to switch majors, I was assigned to create a video on a building. Using Adobe Premiere Pro, I made a video on BLOX, a building located in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
      <p>The audio is on the louder side so be sure to keep the volume low!</p>
